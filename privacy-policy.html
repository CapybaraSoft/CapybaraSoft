    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Chocobara Soft (individual)<br>
       <strong>Contact:</strong> nemuritai1234@gmail.com</p>

    <h2>What this app does</h2>
    <p><strong>{APP_NAME}</strong> provides current UV index information and related guidance. The app is free to use and supported by advertising.</p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <h3>1) Information you provide</h3>
    <p>We don’t require you to create an account or submit personal information to use the app.</p>

    <h3>2) Information collected automatically (through our advertising partner)</h3>
    <p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to show ads. When ads load, Google and its partners may collect information such as the Advertising ID (AAID), IP address and coarse location, device/app information, and ad interaction data. This is used to deliver, limit, and measure ads; detect fraud/abuse; and (where permitted) personalize ads. Learn more from Google: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.</p>

    <h3>3) Location (optional)</h3>
    <p>If you enable location permission, the app uses your device’s location only to fetch the local UV index. You can deny this permission in Android settings; the app may offer a way to set a location manually. We do not store your location on our own servers.</p>
    <p><em>Optional: If the app fetches UV data from a third‑party service, replace this line with your provider’s name and link: <strong>{UV_DATA_PROVIDER_NAME}</strong> — <a href="{UV_DATA_PROVIDER_PRIVACY_URL}">{UV_DATA_PROVIDER_PRIVACY_URL}</a>.</em></p>

    <h2>Legal bases & regional details</h2>
    <h3>EEA/UK/Switzerland (GDPR)</h3>
    <p>We use Google’s <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> to obtain consent for ad purposes when required. You’ll see a consent dialog on first launch in these regions. Your choice controls what data is used for advertising. To change your choice later, open the app → <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Privacy options</strong>.</p>

    <h3>United States (CCPA/CPRA)</h3>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information in the common sense of the word. For advertising, Google may process your device data to show ads; you can limit ad personalization at the system level (Android settings: Google → Ads → reset/delete Advertising ID).</p>

    <h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
    <p>This app is not directed to children under the age of digital consent. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>We share data with <strong>Google AdMob</strong> solely to serve and measure ads. See Google’s advertising policy pages for details on what they collect and how you can control it: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>. We do not sell personal data, and we don’t share data with other third parties except as necessary for app functionality, compliance, or legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Data storage & retention</h2>
    <p>We do not run our own backend for this app. We do not retain personal data on our servers. Ad data handled by Google follows Google’s retention policies.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We rely on platform security features (Android permissions, transport encryption) and reputable partners (Google AdMob). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we strive to use commercially reasonable measures.</p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent & preferences:</strong> Use the in‑app <strong>Privacy options</strong> to review or change your choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Limit ads tracking:</strong> On Android, you can reset or delete your Advertising ID in system settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can revoke location or other permissions in Android settings at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be processed by Google on servers located outside your country. Google uses safeguards such as standard contractual clauses where applicable. See Google’s policy for details: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We’ll post the new version in this location and update the “Effective date” above. Your continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or requests regarding this policy, contact us at <strong>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</strong>.</p>
